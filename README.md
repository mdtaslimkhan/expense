## 💽 SQLite Setup

- The app initializes a local SQLite database on launch.
- Transactions are stored persistently and loaded into Redux on startup.
- CRUD operations are performed both in Redux and SQLite to keep them in sync.

## 📦 Future Enhancements

- Cloud sync (Firebase / Supabase)
- User authentication
- Dark mode
- Graphs & charts for analytics
